Lai Jiun-Ting is a new media artist born and raised in Taipei. His practice focuses on the relationship between technology rights and individuals, and is currently working on the subject of “cognitive enhancement based on human-AI integration” through experimenting wearable and intricately integrated devices that enhance human cognition as an intermediary means to resist “implantable surveillance capitalism.” He utilizes electroreception of the human tongue as a means to create perceptual sculpture and experiments with the potentiality of human cognitive enhancement on the body part in an invasive yet non-implanted fashion.
At the moment, he continues with his journey of exploring electro-tactility as a form of art in Taipei.

In 2024, he founded the art-tech company "Aisthesis Savage Co., Ltd.,"
"In a world beyond the reach of perception, we are all uncivilized savages." Aisthesis Savage is a tech-art
company dedicated to art-driven technological innovation, exploring the boundaries of human perception
through artistic creation. By combining electro-tactile technology, cyborg art, mixed reality (MR), and
artificial intelligence (AI), the company explores and creates future art forms.

Background :Artist/Artistic Director and CEO of Aisthesis Savage Co., Ltd., has participated in
numerous domestic and international exhibitions and received grants such as Siggraph,
