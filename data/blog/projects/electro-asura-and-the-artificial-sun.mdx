summary: "**Electro Asura and the Artificial Sun**" is Aisthesis Savage's latest experimental work, a collaboration with Korean award-winning dancer Woosang and Korean art production studio Crane. This cross-disciplinary new media theateral performance integrates artificial intelligence, enhanced electro-tactile technology, and immersive environments. The work demonstrates the path of human transformation into a cybernetic Asura, where dancers interface with Aisthesis Savage's mechanical prosthetics and augmented sensory technology, engaging in dialogue with the embedded LLM-driven AI Agent SUN to explore human perceptual mutations in the cyber age.

"**Electro Asura and the Artificial Sun**" is Aisthesis Savage's latest experimental work, a collaboration with Korean award-winning dancer Woosang and Korean art production studio Crane. This cross-disciplinary new media theateral performance integrates artificial intelligence, enhanced electro-tactile technology, and immersive environments. The work demonstrates the path of human transformation into a cybernetic Asura, where dancers interface with Aisthesis Savage's mechanical prosthetics and augmented sensory technology, engaging in dialogue with the embedded LLM-driven AI Agent SUN to explore human perceptual mutations in the cyber age.

During regular exhibitions, audiences can engage in dialogue with "SUN", a digital twin virtual being connected to open-source large language model (Llama3-405b), realizing immersive AI interaction and showcasing a new form of human-machine consciousness integration.

"If the key to becoming Buddha is letting go of physical senses, becoming a cyborg means embarking on the path of Asura - neither human, nor divine, nor Buddha."

In the performance, the dancer's wearable devices extend Eastern supernatural experiences to the body, not only utilizing the basic five human senses but also augmenting and developing "second organ" electro-tactility as a means of practice. This explores the possibilities of electro-tactility, mechanical prosthetics, and AI co-performance, becoming a mechanical chimera hybrid where AI dialogue drives the entire performance, creating a new form of hybrid artistic performance.
