Crane is not a conventional studio, but rather a production where ideas manifest physically — whether through visual arts, performing arts, books, or other forms of expression. Through its production processes, Crane investigates tangible ways to engage with power structures emerging at the intersection of art, society, and technology; it challenges what these fields have been all along. Their method is based on cultural studies, questioning the sociocultural aspects in art.
