공적 공간과 사적 공간이 기묘하게 결합된 설치 작업 파운틴 인 트랜짓(2023)을 한옥 앞마당에 선보여 많은 호응을 얻었던 이요나는 이번 개인전을 통해 미술관의 건축적 구조에 더욱 적극적으로 개입하며 작업적 확장을 시도한다. 미술관의 내부와 외부, 지상과 옥상을 물리적/개념적으로 연결한 작가의 대규모 신작 프로덕션은 크리에이티브뉴질랜드의 후원을 받아 구현되었다.\\n\\n이요나: 공간 배치 서울\\n\\n아트선재센터는 오는 5월 24일부터 8월 4일까지 아트선재센터의 한옥과 내부 계단 그리고 옥상정원을 연결하는 장소 특정적 전시 《이요나: 공간 배치 서울》을 개최한다.\\n\\n지난해 아트선재센터에서 열린 그룹전 《오프사이트》에서 공적 공간과 사적 공간이 기묘하게 결합된 설치 작업 파운틴 인 트랜짓(2023)을 한옥 앞마당에 선보여 많은 호응을 얻었던 이요나는 이번 개인전을 통해 미술관의 건축적 구조에 더욱 적극적으로 개입하며 작업적 확장을 시도한다. 미술관의 내부와 외부, 지상과 옥상을 물리적/개념적으로 연결한 작가의 대규모 신작 프로덕션은 크리에이티브뉴질랜드의 후원을 받아 구현되었다.\\n\\n이요나는 전 세계 도시 환경에 보편적으로 사용되는 재료인 스테인리스 스틸 배관을 일상적인 사물과 결합해 사회 구조 안에 존재하는 여러 이분법적인 구분과 경계를 허무는 작업을 이어왔다. 그의 작업은 공간이 가진 본래의 건축적 구조와 문법을 수용하면서도 작품이 전시되는 공간에 부여된 통상적 관념과 규범을 비틀어 공간의 수직적 위계와 수평적 경계들을 지워 나간다. 이번 전시에서는 건물의 내부와 외부, 사적 공간과 공적 공간 사이의 경계를 물리적/개념적으로 지우는 동시에 서울이라는 도시에 함축된 다양한 층위의 시간과 속도를 연결한다.\\n\\n전시와 동일한 제목의 작품 공간 배치 서울(2024)은 미술관 바깥에 위치한 낮은 한옥에서 출발해 미술관 내부의 수직적인 계단을 타고 가장 높은 옥상정원으로 향하는 이동의 방향을 제시한다. 건물의 내부와 외부, 서로 다른 층계를 오가는 전시의 경로 사이에 침실 가구나 욕실, 주방, 미화 용품처럼 지나치게 사적이고 실용적이기에 전시장에서 보이지 않아야 할 것 같은 사물들을 놓음으로써 전시 공간이 가진 통념을 흩트린다. 공간의 위계와 구조를 뒤섞는 사물의 배치는 관객이 관람자로서 요구받은 행동양식에 스스로 질문하게 하고, 규범을 넘어 작품에 직접 반응하고 개입하기를 유도한다.\\n\\n전시에 활용된 작은 한옥이 빼곡히 들어선 스테인리스 스틸 배관 조각으로 인해 공간으로서 기능할 수 없어진 데 반해, 넓은 옥상정원은 외곽에만 조각을 설치하고 중심부를 텅 비워 두어 두 공간의 밀도의 대비를 극명히 드러낸다. 한국에서 태어나 어린 시절 뉴질랜드로 이주한 이요나는 두 국가가 가진 상반된 도시의 밀도와 일상의 속도를 각기 다른 시기에 교차해 경험했다. 서울의 복잡한 지하철 노선, 역과 역 사이의 촘촘한 간격, 분주한 환승역, 신호를 기다리는 인파와 줄지은 버스, 빠르게 지나가는 창밖 풍경 등 작가 개인의 경험과 중첩해 인지한 도시의 움직임과 속도를 스테인리스 스틸 배관을 매개로 꿰어낸다. 또한 작가는 스테인리스 스틸 배관에 하차 벨이나 버스 손잡이, 신호등, 벤치 등 우리가 이동 중에 발견하는 사물들을 결합해 작품이 설치된 전통 한옥과 현대적인 미술관 건물에 쌓인 서로 다른 시간성을 지금 이 순간의 시간으로 작동하게 한다.\\n\\n미술관의 건축 공간을 따라가는 이번 전시는 경로의 마지막 지점인 옥상정원을 너머 서울의 실제 풍경으로 확장되고, 이요나의 작업은 도시 환경의 일부가 되어 어두워진 서울과 미술관 옥상정원의 밤을 비춘다. 《이요나: 공간 배치 서울》은 현대사회가 요구하는 효율성에 입각해 점점 더 분리되어지는 공간과, 기술의 발전으로 압축되어 사라지는 시간을 이어보면서, 이분법적 사고와 개념의 경계들을 지우고, 빠른 속도로 흘러가는 도시에서 우리가 잃어버리는 장면들을 붙잡는다. 한편 전시는 공간에 대한 장소 특정적 개입을 시도하는 이요나의 작업을 통해 미술관의 유휴 공간을 활용하고, 건물에 위치한 여러 공간을 연결함으로써 미술관을 경험하는 관람자의 감각을 확장하고자 한다.","code":"var Component=(()=>{var h=Object.create;var a=Object.defineProperty;var m=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var
